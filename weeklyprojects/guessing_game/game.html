The first version of the game was a guessing game where the user was asked to guess how many cups of coffee it took to keep me functional each week. This game was not a great candidate for some of the features I needed to add, so I started over from scratch.

The new game is a guessing game of modern Doctor Who companions. There is an HTML list of names that serves as a word bank in case the user doesn't know their names.

The game uses an array to create objects with the specified attributes.

The user is first prompted for a number and the number determines the correct answer, so the answer can be one of 5 companions.

The user then has 3 chances to guess the correct companion and is given a hint using an attribute of that compation for the second and third prompts.

If the user does not correctly guess the answer, they are given the correct name and the manner in which their journey with the doctor ended.
